# JavaScript Questions Practice

A focused space for practicing JavaScript concepts through small, iterative exercises. This repo is meant for learning by doing: explore ideas, try approaches, refine solutions, and build confidence one question at a time.

## What This Is
- A lightweight practice repository for sharpening JavaScript skills
- A place to experiment, refactor, and revisit solutions over time
- A personal learning log that grows with consistent practice

## How To Use It
- Pick a topic or problem, attempt a solution, and iterate
- Revisit older work to improve clarity and efficiency
- Treat each exercise as a chance to explore core language features

## Why It Exists
Steady repetition turns concepts into intuition. This repo is a simple, no-friction environment for that practice.
